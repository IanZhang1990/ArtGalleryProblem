Considering two methods of sampling new spehres:

1: sample spheres along the boundary of existing spheres. Keep the sphere as long as the center is not inside another sphere and the radius is not less than delta.

2: randomly sample spheres. Keep the sphere as long as the center is not inside another sphere and the radius is not less than delta.

Prove: 
 The first algorithm is better than the second one:

 1. Coverage: the first algorithm covers the most area, yet the second algorithm can cover that much area only in the best case.
 2. Connectivity: the first algorithm guaranttes the connectivity between two circles, thus an optimal path can be found. While the second algorithm is possible to lost connection, thus the optimal path is broken.
